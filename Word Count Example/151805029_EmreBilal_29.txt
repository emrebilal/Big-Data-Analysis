Exercise 3.3. Python provides a built-in function called len that returns the length of a string, so the value of len('allen') is 5.
Writeafunctionnamed right_justify thattakesastringnamed s asaparameterandprintsthe string with enough leading spaces so that the last letter of the string is in column 70 of the display.
>>> right_justify('allen')
allen Exercise3.4. Afunctionobjectisavalueyoucanassigntoavariableorpassasanargument. For example, do_twice is a function that takes a function object as an argument and calls it twice:
def do_twice(f): f() f() Here’s an example that uses do_twice to call a function named print_spam twice.
def print_spam(): print 'spam'
do_twice(print_spam)
1. Type this example into a script and test it.
2. Modify do_twice sothatittakestwoarguments,afunctionobjectandavalue,andcallsthe function twice, passing the value as an argument.
3. Write a more general version of print_spam, called print_twice, that takes a string as a parameter and prints it twice.
4. Use the modi?ed version of do_twice to call print_twice twice, passing 'spam' as an argument.
5. De?ne a new function called do_four that takes a function object and a value and calls the functionfourtimes,passingthevalueasaparameter. Thereshouldbeonlytwostatementsin the body of this function, not four.
